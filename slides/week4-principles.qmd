## Principles of effective design

A good figure should:

* convey a clear message or story
* avoid excessive complexity
* look nice
* be well-labeled and appropriately sized
* stand alone with a short caption

. . .

Here we'll mostly look at lots of examples.

## On color

Color is one of the most frequently used aesthetics and is easy to misuse.

* choice of color scale should match the data
* use of color should take account of colorblindness
* color can only encode a limited amount of information

## Color scales

There are three types of color scales.

1. *Qualitative* scales are non-monotonic sets of colors.
2. *Sequential* scales are monotonic sets of colors spanning a color gradient.
3. *Diverging* scales are sequential scales centered at a neutral color.

## Qualitative scales

*Qualitative* scales are non-monotonic sets of colors.

![](figures/qualitative-scales-1.png)

. . .

Useful for displaying categorical variables with few levels.

## Sequential scales

*Sequential* scales are monotonic sets of colors spanning a color gradient.

![](figures/sequential-scales-1.png)

. . .

Useful for continuous variables.

## Sequential scales

![Example sequential color scale](figures/map-Texas-income-1.png)

## Diverging scales

*Diverging* scales are sequential scales centered at a neutral color.

![](figures/diverging-scales-1.png)

. . .

Useful for continuous variables with a 'natural' center.

## Diverging scales

![](figures/map-Texas-race-1.png)

## Use of color

Common mistakes:

1. Encoding too much information
2. Poor choice of scale
3. Not accounting for colorblindness

## TMI

![](figures/popgrowth-vs-popsize-colored-1.png)

## Better

![](figures/popgrowth-vs-popsize-bw-1.png)

. . .

*Avoid encoding more than 5 categories using color*

## Inappropriate scales

The color scale doesn't match the data well, since the rainbow scale emphasizes arbitrary data values. In addition, colors here are too intense.

![](figures/map-Texas-rainbow-1.png)

## Better

![](figures/map-Texas-race-1.png)

. . .

A diverging scale is appropriate here because 50% is a natural midpoint in context.

## Color blindness

Color vision deficiency (CVD) or colorblindness refers to difficulty distinguishing specific colors.

* red-green CVD: protanomaly and deuteranomaly
* blue-yellow CVD: tritanomaly

## CVD-friendly scales

Some color scales still retain visible contrast for different types of color vision deficiency (CVD). 

Here is a simulation (for those without CVD).

![Color scale shown for different types of colorblindness using CVD simulator](figures/heat-cvd-sim-1.png)

## CVD-unfriendly scales

Other scales get muddled.

![](figures/red-green-cvd-sim-1.png)

. . .

*When in doubt, use a CVD simulator to check figures*

## Another approach: redundancy

When possible, use 'redundant coding' -- map the same variable to color *and* one other aesthetic.

![](figures/iris-scatter-three-shapes-1.png)

## Redundancy

When possible, use 'redundant coding' -- map the same variable to color *and* one other aesthetic.

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
#| tags: []

pop = pd.read_csv('data/population.csv', encoding = 'latin1').melt(
    id_vars = ['Country Name', 'Country Code'],
    var_name = 'Year',
    value_name = 'Population'
)

countryinfo = pd.read_csv('data/country-info.csv').rename(
    columns = {'alpha-3': 'Country Code', 'region': 'Region'}
).loc[:, ['Country Code', 'Region']]

popregion = pd.merge(
    countryinfo, 
    pop, 
    how = 'right', 
    on = ['Country Code']
).dropna().astype(
    {'Region': 'category'}
).groupby(
    ['Region', 'Year']
).sum().reset_index()

alt.Chart(
    popregion
).mark_line(
).encode(
    x = 'Year:T',
    y = alt.Y('Population', scale = alt.Scale(type = 'log', zero = False)),
    color = 'Region',
    strokeDash = 'Region'
).properties(
    width = 500, height = 150
).configure_axis(
    labelFontSize = 16,
    titleFontSize = 16
).configure_legend(
    labelFontSize = 16,
    titleFontSize = 16
)
```

. . .

Redundancy provides a failsafe against *any* circumstance that might compromise the effectiveness of color:

- printers or black-and-white printing
- projectors, displays, and lighting conditions
- CVD

## Faceting

You've already made a faceted plot. 

![](figures/brfs-ace.png)

. . .

Notice the redundant use of color!

## Faceting

Facets are another way to encode categorical variables *when side-by-side comparisons are of interest*.

. . .

The most common blunders with faceting are:

1. Free axis scales are misleading
2. Facet layout isn't conducive to comparison of interest

## Many facets

Often a big panel of scatterplots can be a useful exploratory graphic.

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=60%}
![Movie ratings from IMDB](figures/movie-rankings-1.png){width=500}
:::

::: {.column width=40%}
The figure shows a lot:

1. Timespan of data 1906-2005
2. More observations (movies) in later years
3. Higher vote counts in later years
4. Higher rating variance among movies with fewer votes
5. Long term reversal of voting/rating trend

## Use fixed axis scales

![Example of facets with different y axes](figures/BA-degrees-variable-y-lims-1.png)

. . .

Suggests, misleadingly, that Education declined by the same amount as social science and history.

## Use fixed axis scales

![Same as before, with common fixed axis scales.](figures/BA-degrees-fixed-y-lims-1.png)

## What about this?

One axis is fixed, one is free.

![A figure from HW2](figures/seda-fig1.png)

. . .

The variable of interest, Gap, is still comparable across facets. So only one axis needs to be fixed.

. . .

What would it look like if all axis scales were fixed? Would comparisons be easier or harder?

## Labels and legends

The most common blunders with regard to labels are:

1. Use of dataframe column names as labels
2. Obscure or uninterpretable labels
3. Too small or too big

. . .

For sizing, it's important to pay attention to the *balance* of labels, whitespace, and graphical elements.

## Sizing

Usually figure defaults look fine on your IDE but render too small when graphics are exported.

![These will be illegible in slide presentations, reports, etc.](figures/Aus-athletes-small-1.png)

## Sizing

These labels are legible, but still too small -- they take up a minimum of space in the figure.

![Unbalanced text/graphic/whitespace](figures/Aus-athletes-ugly-1.png)

## Sizing

Use larger labels than you think you'll need.

![Balanced](figures/Aus-athletes-good-1.png)

. . .

Note also the mark size is increased a bit.

## Sizing

Don't overdo it.

![Unbalanced again](figures/Aus-athletes-big-ugly-1.png)

## Sizing

If the figure will be reproduced in a scaled-down size, increase all sizes in proportion.

## Tidy graphics?

Graphics should avoid conflating data semantics.

* observational units should be clearly distinguished
* different types of observational units should be shown on different graphics

. . .

In addition, they should avoid conflating observed from inferred quantities.

* aggregated values should be clearly distinguished from individual observations
* predictions, inferred trends, or uncertainty should be shown using a *different* graphical element than observed data
* unless comparing estimates and observations is the point, make separate graphics

## An untidy plot

The starting plot in lab 3 is actually a bad plot because all years are shown together -- so observational units (countries) are not clearly distinguished.

![](figures/gdp-expectancy-bad.png)

## A tidy plot

![](figures/gdp-expectancy.png)

This is tidy, because within facets:

* each bubble represents a country
* any two bubbles represent distinct countries

## Exploration or presentation?

In data exploration, it's more important to generate lots of figures quickly than put a lot of care into details.

* do **not** need to be scrupulous about labels, sizing, color scales, proportionality, etc.
* do need to attend to axis scales and appropriate choice of graphical display (*e.g.*, boxplots vs. densities)
* should keep plots simple; don't try to visualize too much information at once

. . .

In developing presentation graphics, details matter.

* consider all visualization principles, especially sizing, color, etc.
* optimize for communication
