## Recap: tidy data

The tidy standard consists in matching semantics and structure. 

. . .

A dataset is **tidy** if:

1. Each variable is a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each table contains measurements on only one type of observational unit.

. . .

![](figures/tidy-layout.png)

## Why tidy?

> *Why use the tidy standard? Wouldn't any system of organization do just as well?*

. . .

The tidy standard has three main advantages:

1. Having a **consistent system of organization** makes it easier to focus on analysis and exploration. (True of any system)
2. Many **software tools** are designed to work with tidy data inputs. (Tidy only)
3. **Transformation** of tidy data is especially natural in most computing environments due to vectorized operations. (Tidy only)

## Transformations

**Transformations** of data frames are _**operations that modify the shape or values of a data frame**_. These include: 

* Slicing rows and columns by index
* Filtering rows by logical conditions
* Defining new variables from scratch or by operations on existing variables
* Aggregations (min, mean, max, etc.)

## Slicing

**Slicing** refers to retrieving a (usually contiguous) subset (a 'slice') of rows/columns from a data frame.

. . .

Uses:

* data inspection/retrieval
* subsetting for further analysis/manipulation
* data display

## Data display

Recall the UN Development data:
```{python}
#| echo: true
# preview UN data -- note indexed by country
undev.head(3)
```

. . .

*Aside:* `.head()` is a slicing operation -- it returns the 'top' slice of rows.

## Data inspection/retrieval

To inspect the percentage of women in parliament in Mexico, slice accordingly:

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
#| tags: []
#| echo: true
undev.loc[['Mexico'], ['parliament_pct_women']]
```

## Review: `.loc` and `.iloc`

The primary slicing functions in pandas are 

- `.loc` (location) to slice by index
- `.iloc` (integer location) to slice by position

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
#| echo: true
# .iloc equivalent of previous slice
undev.iloc[[111], [6]]
```

. . .

*Check your understanding:* which row in the dataframe is the observation for Mexico?

. . .

If a single index rather than a list is provided -- *e.g.*, `Mexico` rather than `[Mexico]`, -- these functions will return the raw value as a float rather than a dataframe.

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev.loc['Mexico', 'parliament_pct_women']
```

## Larger slices

More typically, a slice will be a contiguous chunk of rows and columns. 

. . .

Slicing operations can interpret `start:end` as shorthand for a range of indices.

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev.loc['Mexico':'Mongolia', ['parliament_pct_women']]
```

. . .

*Note*: `start:end` is inclusive of both endpoints with `.loc`, but not inclusive of the right endpoint with `.iloc`. Get in the habit of double-checking results.

## Defining new variables

Vectorization of operations in pandas and numpy make tidy data especially nice to manipulate mathematically. For example:

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
#| tags: []
#| echo: true
weather2['TRANGE'] = weather2.TMAX - weather2.TMIN
weather2.loc[0:3, ['TMAX', 'TMIN', 'TRANGE']]
```

. . .

This computes $t_{min, i} - t_{max, i}$ for all observations $i = 1, \dots, n$.

. . .

*Check your understanding*: express this calculation as a linear algebra arithmetic operation.

## Your turn

Let's take another example -- consider this slice of the `undev` data:

```{python}
undev.loc[:, ['total_pop', 'urban_pct_pop']].head(3)
```

. . .

With your neighbor, write a line of code that calculates the percentage of the population living in rural areas.

## Filtering {.scrollable}

**Filtering** refers to removing a subset of rows based on one or more conditions. (Think of "filtering out" certain rows.)

. . .

For example, suppose we wanted to retrieve only the countries with populations exceeding 1Bn people:

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev[undev.total_pop > 1000]
```

## Filtering

Technically, filtering works by slicing according to a long logical vector with one entry per row specifying whether to retain (`True`) or drop (`False`).

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev.total_pop > 1000
``` 

## A small puzzle

Consider a random filter:

```{python}
#| echo: true
random_filter = np.random.binomial(n = 1, p = 0.03, size = undev.shape[0]).astype('bool')

random_filter
```

. . .

1. How many rows will `undev[random_filter]` have?
2. How many rows should this random filtering produce on average?

## Logical comparisons

Any of the following relations can be used to define filtering conditions

Symbol | Usage      | Meaning 
------ | ---------- | -------------------
`==`   | `a == b`   | Does a equal b?
`<=`   | `a <= b`   | Is a less than or equal to b?
`>=`   | `a >= b`   | Is a greater than or equal to b?
`<`    | `a < b`    | Is a less than b?
`>`    | `a > b`    | Is a greater than b?
`~`    | `~p`       | Returns negation of p
 <code>&#124;</code>    | `p`  <code>&#124;</code> `q` | p OR q
`&`    | `p & q`    | p AND q
`^`    | `p ^ q` | p XOR q (exclusive or)

## Aggregation 

**Aggregation** refers to any operation that combines many values into fewer values.

. . .

Common aggregation operations include:

* summation $\sum_{i} x_i$
* averaging $n^{-1} \sum_i x_i$
* extrema $\text{min}_i x_i$ and $\text{max}_i x_i$
* statistics: median, variance, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, order statistics, quantiles

## Aggregation vs. other transformations

Aggregations *reduce* the number of values, whereas other transformations do not. 

. . .

A bit more formally:

* aggregations map larger sets of values to smaller sets of values
* transformations map sets of values to sets of the same size

. . .

*Check your understanding*: 

* is $(f*g)(x_i) = \int f(h)g(x_i - h)dh$ an aggregation?
* is $f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \left(\prod_i x_i\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}$  an aggregation?

## Aggregation?

## Example aggregations

In numpy, the most common aggregations are implemented as functions:

numpy | function
---|---
`np.sum()` | $\sum_i x_i$
`np.max()` | $\text{max}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$
`np.min()` | $\text{min}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$
`np.median()` | $\text{median}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$
`np.mean()` | $n^{-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$
`np.var()` | $(n - 1)^{-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$
`np.std()` | $\sqrt{(n - 1)^{-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$
`np.prod()` | $\prod_i x_i$
`np.percentile()` | $\hat{F}^{-1}(q)$

## Argmin and argmax

$\text{argmax}_D f(x)$ refers to the value or values in the domain $D$ of $f$ at which the function attains its maximum -- the *argument in $D$ maximizing $f$*.

. . .

Similarly, $\text{argmax}_i x_i$ refers to the index (or indices, if ties) of the largest value in the set $\{x_i\}$.

. . .

*Check your understanding*: what does the following return?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
np.array([1, 5, 10, 2]).argmin()
```

## Argmin and argmax

These index retrieval functions can be handy for slicing rows of interest. 

. . .

For example, which country had the largest percentage of women in parliament in the year the UN development data was collected?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
undev.index[undev.parliament_pct_women.argmax()]
```

. . .

And what were the observations?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
undev.iloc[undev.parliament_pct_women.argmax(), :]
```

## Dataframe aggregations

In pandas, the numpy aggregation operations are available as dataframe methods that apply the corresponding operation over each column:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# mean of every column
undev.mean()
```

## Row-wise aggregation

In general, supplying the argument `axis = 1` will compute *rowwise* aggregations. For example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# sum `pop_under5`, `pop_15to64`, and `pop_over65`
undev.iloc[:, 2:5].sum(axis = 1).head(3)
```

. . .

This facilitates, for example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev['pop_5to14'] = undev.total_pop - undev.iloc[:, 2:5].sum(axis = 1)
```

## Argmin/idxmin and argmax/idxmax

In pandas, `np.argmin()` and `np.argmax()` are implemented as `pd.df.idxmin()` and `pd.df.idxmax()`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
undev.idxmax()
```

## Other functions {.scrollable}

Pandas has a wide array of other aggregation and transformation functions. To show just one example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
## slice weather data
weather4 = weather1.set_index('DATE').iloc[:, 2:4]
weather4.head(2)
```

. . .

```{python}
#| echo: true
# rolling average
weather4.rolling(window = 7).mean().head(10)
```

## Check your understanding

Interpret this result:

```{python}
#| echo: true
weather4.rolling(window = 7).mean().idxmax()
```

(The weather data is January through March.)

## Custom functions

See the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) for a comprehensive list of transformations and aggregations.

. . .

If pandas doesn't have a method for an operation you're wanting to perform, you can implement custom transformations/aggregations with:

* `pd.df.apply()` or `pd.df.transform()` apply a function row-wise or column-wise
* `pd.df.agg()` or `pd.df.aggregate()`

## Custom functions

Here's an example:

```{python}
# read in gdp data
gdp = pd.read_csv('data/annual_growth.csv', encoding = 'latin1').set_index('Country Name').drop(columns = 'Country Code').dropna(axis = 0)

gdp.head(2)
```

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
#| echo: true
# convert percentages to proportions
gdp_prop = gdp.transform(lambda x: x/100 + 1)

# compute geometric mean
gdp_prop.aggregate(
    lambda x: np.prod(x)**(1/len(x)), 
    axis = 1).head(4)
```

## Your turn

Here's the country with the highest annualized GDP growth for the period 1961-2019:

```{python}
gdp_annualized = gdp_prop.aggregate(
    lambda x: np.prod(x)**(1/len(x)), 
    axis = 1)
    
gdp_annualized[[gdp_annualized.idxmax()]]

```

. . .

*How did I find this?* Suppose that the result on the previous slide were stored as `gdp_annualized`. Write a line of code that generates the result shown above.

## Grouped aggregations

Suppose we wanted to compute annualized growth by decade for each country.

. . .

To do so, we'd compute the same aggregation (geometric mean) repeatedly for subsets of data values. This is called a **grouped** aggregation.

. . .

Usually, one defines a grouping of dataframe rows using columns in the dataset. For example:

```{python}
# rearrange data for grouping
gdp_long = gdp_prop.melt(
    value_name = 'growth', 
    var_name = 'year', 
    ignore_index = False
).reset_index()

gdp_long['year'] = gdp_long.year.astype('int')
gdp_long['decade'] = (gdp_long.year - np.mod(gdp_long.year, 10))

gdp_decades = gdp_long.drop(columns = 'year')
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
gdp_decades.head(4)
```

. . .

*How should the rows be grouped?*

## `.groupby`

In pandas, `df.groupby('COLUMN')` defines a grouping of dataframe rows in which each group is a set of rows with the same value of `'COLUMN'`. 

* There will be exactly as many groups as the number of unique values in `'COLUMN'`.
* Multiple columns may be specified to define a grouping, *e.g.*, `df.groupby(['COL1', 'COL2'])`
* Subsequent operations will be performed group-wise

## Annualized GDP growth by decade {.scrollable}

Returning to our example:

```{python}
#| echo: true
gdp_anngrowth = gdp_decades.groupby(
    ['Country Name', 'decade']
    ).aggregate(
    lambda x: np.prod(x)**(1/len(x))
    )

gdp_anngrowth
```

## Your turn

*How do you find the country with the highest annualized GDP growth for each decade?*

. . .

Write a line of code that would perform this calculation.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gdp_anngrowth...
```

```{python}
#| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}
gdp_anngrowth.groupby('decade').idxmax()
```

## Recap

* In tidy data, rows and columns correspond to observations and variables.
    + This provides a standard dataset structure that facilitates exploration and analysis.
    + Many datasets are not stored in this format.
    + Transformation operations are a lot easier with tidy data, due in part to the way tools in pandas are designed.

* Transformations are operations that modify the shape or values of dataframes. We discussed
    + slicing
    + filtering
    + creating new variables
    + aggregations (mean, min, max, argmin, etc.)
    + grouped aggregations

* Dataframe manipulations will be used throughout the course to tidy up data and perform various inspections and summaries.

## Up next

We started *en media res* at this stage of the lifecyle (tidy) so that you could start developing skills that would enable you to jump right into playing with datasets.

. . .

Next week, we'll backtrack to the data collection and assessment stages of a project and discuss:

* sampling
* scope of inference
* data assessment
* missing data
