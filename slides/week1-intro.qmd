# Case studies: a preview

## Case study 1: ACE and health

![Association between adverse childhood experiences and general health, by sex.](figures/brfs-ace.png)

## Case study 1: ACE and health

You will:

- process and recode 10K survey responses from CDC's 2019 behavior risk factor surveillance survey (BRFSS)
- cross-tabulate health-related measurements with frequency of adverse childhood experiences

## Case study 2: SEDA

![Education achievement gaps as functions of socioeconomic indicators, by gender.](figures/seda-fig.png)

## Case study 2: SEDA

You will:

- merge test scores and socioeconomic indicators from the 2018 Standford Education Data Archive by school district
- visually assess correlations between gender achievement gaps among grade schoolers and socioeconomic indicators across school districts in CA

## Case study 3: Paleoclimatology

## Case study 3: Paleoclimatology

![Clustering of diatom relative abundances in pleistocene (pre-11KyBP) vs. holocene (post-11KyBP) epochs.](figures/diatom.png)

## Case study 3: Paleoclimatology

You will:

- explore ecological community structure from relative abundances of diatoms measured in ocean sediment core samples spanning ~15,000 years
- use dimension reduction techniques to obtain measures of community structure
- identify shifts associated with the transition from pleistocene to holocene epochs

## Case study 4: Discrimination at DDS?

## Case study 4: Discrimination at DDS?

![Expenditure is strongly associated with age.](figures/dds-2.png)

## Case study 4: Discrimination at DDS?

![Correcting for age shows comparable expenditure across racial groups.](figures/dds-3.png)

## Case study 4: Discrimination at DDS?

You will:

- assess the case for discrimination in allocation of DDS benefits
- identify confounding factors present in the sample
- model median expenditure by racial group after correcting for age

# About the course

## Scope

This course is about developing your data science toolkit with foundational skills:

1. Core competency with Python data science libraries
2. Critical thinking about data
3. Visualization and exploratory analysis
4. Application of basic statistical concepts and methods in practice
5. Communication and interpretation of results

## What's unique about PSTAT100?

There are a few distinctive aspects:

* multiple end-to-end case studies
* question-driven rather than method-driven
* emphasis on project workflow
* data storytelling and communication

## Limitations

There are also some things we *won't* cover:

* Predictive modeling or machine learning
* Algorithm design and implementation
* Techniques and methods for big data
* Theoretical basis for methods

## Weekly Pattern

We'll follow a simple weekly pattern:

* **Mondays** 
    - Lecture
    - Assignments due 11:59pm PST

* **Wednesdays** 
    - Lecture
* **Thursdays**
    - Section

## Assessments

* **Labs** introduce and develop core skills
* **Homeworks** apply core skills to case studies
* **Projects** practice creative problem-solving
    
## Policies

* **Communication**
    + If you have questions, please come to office hours
    + Avoid email except for personal matters

* **Deadlines and late work**
    + One-hour grace period on all deadlines
    + 24-hour late submissions
    + Two free lates on any assignment (except last assignment)
    + 75% partial credit thereafter for late work

## Policies

* **Grades**
    + Final weighting and grade assignment at instructor's discretion
    + Do not expect 92+% = A, 90-92% = A-, 87-89.9 = B+, etc.
    + A's are awarded sparingly and indicate exceptional work

## Other info

* Informal section swaps are allowed with TA permission
* Attendance required at all class meetings, but a few absences without notice are okay
* Honors contracts not available this quarter
* Office hours start week 2, check website for schedule

## Getting started
